# Exchange Application

## Overview

The Exchange Application is a system designed for processing and executing orders for floral instruments. It allows users to submit orders via a CSV file and generates an execution report, detailing the status of each order. The application handles validations and provides feedback on the execution status of submitted orders.

## Features

- **Order Submission**: Upload a CSV file containing orders for processing.
- **Validation Checks**: Ensures that orders meet specific criteria (e.g., valid quantities, prices, and instrument types).
- **Execution Reporting**: Generates a detailed report of order executions, including status updates (New, Filled, Partially Filled, Rejected).
- **CSV Output**: Writes the execution report to a CSV file for further analysis.
